# AI Chat Application PRD

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the design, architecture, and development requirements for the AI chat application. The application will support:

1. **Chat Functionality**
2. **Web Search Integration**
3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
4. **Workflow Automation**

The goal is to create a scalable, modular application that follows UX best practices and provides a seamless user experience, leveraging modern tools and frameworks.

## 1. General Requirements

### Key Objectives
- Deliver a user-friendly, interactive chat application with a similar UX to ChatGPT.
- Implement modular functionality for chat, web search, RAG, and workflow automation as separate features.
- Use Tailwind CSS for the frontend and containerized deployment with Docker Compose.
- Provide support for local debugging with live updates.

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js with Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI, incorporating LangChain/LangGraph for advanced AI capabilities.
- **Deployment**: Separate containers for frontend and backend using Docker Compose.
- **Secrets Management**: Store the OpenAI API key in a `.env` file.
- **Open Source Libraries**: Use open-source libraries for vector databases and web search integration.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### A. Chat Functionality
**Description**: Create a core chat experience allowing users to interact with an AI model.

**Features**:
1. Text-based conversational interface.
2. Markdown support for formatted responses.
3. Token count display for user inputs.
4. Basic error handling (e.g., handling empty inputs).
5. Support for session-based memory (via LangChain).

**Backend Integration**:
- API endpoint to handle chat requests using the OpenAI GPT model.
- Include adjustable parameters (temperature, max tokens, etc.).

**Frontend Requirements**:
- Intuitive input box with auto-resizing.
- Display AI responses in a user-friendly format.

### B. Web Search Integration
**Description**: Integrate web search to supplement AI responses with real-time information.

**Features**:
1. Allow users to trigger web search for queries requiring real-time information.
2. Display search results inline with AI responses.
3. Filter and prioritize search results to align with user intent.

**Backend Integration**:
- Use open-source web scraping or search libraries to fetch results (e.g., Scrapy, Beautiful Soup).
- Combine web search results with AI-generated text using LangChain.

**Frontend Requirements**:
- Toggle for enabling/disabling web search.
- Clear distinction between AI-generated content and web-based information.

### C. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
**Description**: Enable the app to retrieve context from a document repository for more accurate and relevant responses.

**Features**:
1. Support for uploading documents (PDF, TXT, DOCX).
2. Store and index documents in a vector database using open-source solutions (e.g., FAISS).
3. Integrate retrieved information into chat responses.

**Backend Integration**:
- Implement LangChain's document loaders and retrievers.
- Manage embeddings with OpenAI or similar models.

**Frontend Requirements**:
- Upload interface for users to provide context documents.
- Progress indicator for document indexing.

---

### D. Workflow Automation
**Description**: Allow users to define and execute automated workflows through the chat interface.

**Features**:
1. Predefined workflows for common tasks (e.g., sending emails, setting reminders).
2. Customizable workflows using natural language.
3. Integration with third-party APIs (e.g., Slack, Google Calendar).

**Backend Integration**:
- Use LangChain tools for API chaining and workflow execution.
- Include support for user authentication and authorization.

**Frontend Requirements**:
- Dropdown menu for selecting predefined workflows.
- Chat-based interface for defining and modifying workflows.

---

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**: Ensure low latency for chat responses (<1 second for most queries).
2. **Scalability**: Begin with light usage support and scale incrementally as needed.
3. **Security**: Use HTTPS for all API calls. Store sensitive data in `.env` and secure databases.
4. **Testing**: Include unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

---

## 4. Deployment and Debugging

### Development Approach
1. **Iterative Development**:
   - Start with basic project structure and Docker setup
   - Implement core features incrementally
   - Enhance and refine features based on feedback
   - Update documentation as requirements evolve

### Local Debugging
1. Use `npm run dev`
